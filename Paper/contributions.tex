\subsubsection{Contributions:}

All team members participated in writing the final report. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Will Thomas and Logan Schmallz collaborated to construct the renaming functions and collect experimental dataset.
    \item Jack Reynolds and Will Thomas collaborated to construct the mutation and testing harness.
    \item Jack Reynolds collected supporting research used the the final report.
    \item Bryan Richlinski constructed a Theorem statement parser and structural rewriter. We were ultimately unable to implement
    this tool as it requires an accompanying proof repair mechanism. 
    Future work will expand upon this aspect of mutation and the effect it has on LLM evaluation.
