\paragraph{Evaluating LLM-generated code in Coq}

The core question of this work aims to evaluate
the ability of LLMs to produce correct Coq proofs
despite input obfuscation.

Proof Automation with Large Language Models\cite{proofautomationwithllms}



\paragraph{Creating datasets}
To properly evaluate LLM performance on
Coq code generation requires a corpus of well-structured
proofs of theorems. For some language processing tasks
there are large bodies of existing works that can be leveraged for this purpose, 
with proper consideration for authorized and ethical reuse.
News media can serve as authoritative examples of
well-formatted natural language, and for popular programming
languages such as Python, C, and JavaScript many large
open-source projects exist.
As theorem provers are relevant to a much smaller audience, the pool of quality examples in Coq is
comparatively small.
\citet{learningtoprove} compose a bespoke solution
to this problem. They collected over 70,000 human-written proofs
from over 100 different Coq projects to produce CoqGym,
a dataset and training environment for deep learning models.

\paragraph{Methodology in Coq against other languages}
In our target domain, Coq proofs, 
we are interested in the formal correctness of our LLM output.
For Proof scripts in a theorem prover,
the correctness of the generated code is proved true
simply by running the proof in the theorem prover.
If code type-checks without an error it is guaranteed to be correct.
In typical LLM code generation,
there are a few criteria for judging the quality of LLM generated code.  
A common metric for program correctness is behavioral correctness,
which can be accomplished by comparing the outputs of generated code
and a known correct program on the problem specification such as through unit testing.
Text similarity between ground truth code and the LLM output can be used
in cases where an LLM may produce code that is conceptually close
to correct code but features syntax errors that may render an
otherwise accurate solution unable to be compiled.
\citet{CodeJudge} present CodeJudge, a novel technique
used to evaluate LLM-generated code using another LLM.
The judging LLM employs "slow thinking" to arrive at a
thorough evaluation of the generated code,
which unlike unit tests or code similarity can consider
more nuanced notions of correctness and can have its
criteria adjusted.
We chose to use proof correctness as evaluation criteria
based upon the objectives of this research.
If the use case for LLM proof generation is to
collaborate with a human programmer,
more flexible evaluation criteria, as those above, may be more relevant.
